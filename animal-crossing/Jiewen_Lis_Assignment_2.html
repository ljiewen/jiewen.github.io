<p>
Today I met Skippy, the bunny that introduced me to Bunny day. He told me about the event and said that he will be back on April 14 to host the annual Bunny Day. 
</p>
</p>I got around 20 eggs each, except for Earth Egg which spawns 3-5 times each day on one island. I had to fly to a different island to obtain more.

<p>
Skippy is gone today. I collected all the DIY recipes through balloons and my villagers. After collecting all the DIY recipes and having 30+ eggs of each kind, I started crafting. 
</p>
<p>
I made all the clothes and furnitures that I could possible make for Bunny Day.

<p>
Bunny day takes place during <i> Sakura Event </i> which means every hard wood trees get turned into Cherry Blossoms. Bunny day DIY recipes drop from ballons therefore 
</p>
<p>
it is blocking normal ballons that contains Cherry Blossom DIY recipes from flying! :( I am done for bunny day now. the last update will be Bunny Day on Apri l2.

<h2>
April 12: Bunny Day.
</h2>
<p>
This is how it looked on the day off! I got all the recipes and sold over 50+ crowns which gave me over a billion bells which was nice. Now that it is back to normal, I can finally fish with ease.
